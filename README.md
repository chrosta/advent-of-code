Advent of code
===
Package of totally ugly code blocks!

2021:
---
* My first season (and i started late). ğŸ™„
* Old and messy code (no time and hard, i ended up after 14 tasks). ğŸ˜•

2022:
---
* New energy (i want to get behind half the tasks, maybe). ğŸ’ª
* I am trying to work from the first day. ğŸ˜¶
